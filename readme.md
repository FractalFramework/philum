Authes:
After install, you become superadmin (level 7).
You can let your users create their own blogs (level 6).
You can delegate admin of design (level 5),
publication to editors (level 4) and members (level 3)
You can add layers (nodes) to repeat all that for others domains.

Precautions:
- Philum is a high-level CMS
- you can use it without touching anything, but you can find things that are very complicated to understand. We apologize for that. It's a professional tool.
In fact, lot of evolutions of the systems are keeped along the times and decades. Most of them are kewl, and more recents, slower, are nice. So we often can do the same thing by differents ways.

How to install:
- put install.php on your server and load it.
- or use git and obtain the daily updates.
- instructions to install a fresh new server, in vps.txt

Message to the world:
Dependency is slavery.
This work is made alone, with exclusive tools for working alone, and everything is much faster and more fun, innovative and scalable.
Nobody likes it, but you are wrong, lol
Because this software at least has been working continuously for twenty years and is always at the cutting edge. And also, I've already said it but it needs to be said again, it consumes 10,000 times less electricity than the others.
