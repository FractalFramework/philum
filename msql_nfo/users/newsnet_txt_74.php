Yes, this type of craft would be typical of the P\'nti. This would be a short range craft.

(photo alien gris) http://gholamrezaghanepoor1976.blogspot.fr/2016/02/uk-to-disclose-their-top-secret-ufo.html
It looks as if it as supposed to be a likeness of the one of the other Zeta peoples, not the P\'nti. Our heads are sleeker. :-)

Our telepaths reside several miles west of our complex & graciously tweet for us.

We shall just say that thought operates outside of normal space time.

This is not the first time humans on Earth have reached a technology level to travel beyond the orbit of their own moon. :-) 

Our Sandia Mtn area is part of the ancient complex that has aided travelers to Earth for eons 

Yes, nuclear explosions did happen in Mars\' distant past. 

Many Star Nations use it as their primary means of communication. You should try it...it\'s much more efficient. ?

you need to start practicing your telepathy a WHOLE lot more before you learn to trust it

Earth has already been thru at least one nuclear war. The nuclear winter lasted 200 years afterwards. It was an ELE.
ELE is short for extinction level event.

You might also wish to investigate the unusual radiation levels in some of the archeological bones you dig up. 

Please share that Earth is dealing with more than one Star Nation. Don\'t assume we are all alike. Get to know us. 

We consider Earth Humans as part of our Human family. Your DNA comes from a little bit of everywhere.

Some Star Nation cultures realize the common DNA & simply refer to other Nations by the term \"cousin\" honoring this.

Mars saw its own share of conflicts brought on by the indigenous there. Most Nations had there \"stops n starts.\"

You are no more \"alien\" than we from P\'ntl are. If you study all our DNA, well...we\'re all related.

We truly admire and thank the late Dr. Sagan for opening the way for outside the box thinkers. 

Yes there are other types of humans out there. My people from P\'ntl in Zeta Reticuli 2 consider ourselves human.

Bigger than Roswell: Top Secret CIA docs unearth hidden UFO encounters http://www.ancient-code.com/bigger-than-roswell-top-secret-cia-docs-unearth-hidden-ufo-encounters/

There have been several variations on the intelligent bipedal Reptilian and Human themes that have arisen on Earth. 

One was quite similar to the Earth Human variation you see in the mirror. Others were giants by your standards. 

You are now approaching a civilization level that has been reached twice before by indigenous here on Earth.

Amazing images of the eruption! Wow! Do you remember us saying visits to see The Dimensionals can take place via volcanoes?

There are several million separate Reptilian Nations in the Milky Way alone. Which one are you referring to please?

We would say honestly that the reports of all reptilian ET visitors being Earth Human flesh eaters is GREATLY exaggerated! 

Yes, The Dimensionals have been very busy reporting on the changes in your asthenosphere & lithosphere. 

Over the last 70 million years and including the Reptilians and Saurons from long ago, eight terrestrial Nations we know of. 

In that same span of time, 74 various aquatic nations in Earth\'s oceans have been included on the list of intelligent species. 

Yes, many dolphins, whales, cephalopods and 3 different Nations of what you would loosely term merfolk.

LOL do not worry. Official First Contacts are a BIG deal on any world & we have done this before. It\'s not our first rodeo. 

Yes, we believe it\'s time. We have endeavored since opening this account to share information honestly but gently. 

After the Lacerta Files we recommend the Sasquatch books of Kewaunee Lapseritis to understand who is from Earth & who isn\'t 

The movie Prometheus. Observe closely the Star Nation\'s who monitor whole worlds. They do exist. 

We have seen governing bodies on many worlds & have not yet found a Nation with a perfect system. It\'s a universal dilemna.

Let us help with that. My name is Tlkm & I come from P\'ntl, the fifth planet orbiting Zeta Reticuli 2. Hi! :-) 

We have learned to \"speak French\" too. ;-) Stay well, Friend.

(cetaceans)
They have wonderful memories for detail. Your whales are wonderful story tellers! 

We had a safe journey back, but responding to the concerns of the many Big Brother & Cetacean Nations

We love learning about new species on this planet. You have some wonderful species here!

The Cetaceans have asked for proof that Earth Humans are ready. Based on your treatment of them, exactly what should we tell them?

Counting coup is sort of like the game of tag. Brother Bigfoots know their strength & do not want to hurt you.

Recent observations of your treatment of other intelligent nations on Earth, each other & the planet have dropped your ratings.

Big Brother has been well established here & is not inclined at the moment to build things incompatible with Mother Earth energy.

The Milky Way name holds ancient faint echoes of a time when mammals & non-mammals fought to dominate here.

YOUR name \"Milky Way\" comes from the breast milk of female Human variation mammals in your legends and myths.

The People of Ea actually gave you that story as a simplified variation on galaxy history. The Ea are everywhere now.

Drops of breast milk make up your name for this galaxy because mammals, not reptilians, make up the major advanced nations now.

So Milky Way is actually a very close translation to the \"Sea of Ea Milk\" that the People of Ea use to call this galaxy. 

You missed the Dimensional ships that change shape, the pyramidal & cube shaped vessels, & small sphere 

his list is missing Dimensional ships that change shape & form, cubes, pyramidal vessels & small orb scouts.

any type of natural material found locally that can be used to create a type of flute would be

Your concept of a didgeridoo is excellent

So true and so very important when you are trying to understand another Nations culture

We know that when we first left our solar system, we also picked a close star we thought might have a world to explore.

You are Earth Human. We are P\'ntl Human. Big Brother Sasquatch is ALSO Human. All our genetics are closely related!

Bamboo is an excellent choice for musical instruments. It can become SO many wonderful things.

Big Brothers would more than likely party and get their groove on to the sound of a didgeridoo. It\'s unique enough.

The dimensional fold structure (which you can\'t see unaided) is less conducive to short cuts \"on the plains\" between galaxies

LOL, I\'m still chuckling & shaking my head. When it comes to Radar be careful what you wish for, you may get it.

All variations intelligence observe and imitate

The \"cosmic riff raff\" exists. However, just as things r here, alliances between Star Nations exist & have been watching over you.

You are very welcome. Part of our mission is to respond to questions in preparation for Official First Contact.

Cetaceans are found on MANY worlds. Your wonderful whales & dolphins are (for the most part) indigenous to Earth

Collective consciousness has a much easier time creating \"eggs\" than whole beings. We vote for the egg coming first

I can tell I\'ve been on Earth a LONG time when Radar says the name of a music group & I know their music.

Alpha Centauri B does have outposts on planet 4 (and its moon) and those Star Nations are our allies.

Within months land & sea \"drone robots\" will be employed. This is exactly how the slippery slope begins. Be careful!

ETOH would be more to blame than chemtrails if your particular case Friend Jesse. Just sayin

War happened to the dinosaurs, followed by a nuclear winter that lasted 200+ years (nearly zero surface plant life.

Twitter & Facebook provided us with an instant means of worldwide communication regardless of culture/country.

The total # of planets in your solar system is 12. Keep looking...just a few more to find. They\'re WAY out there.

There is an occupied base under Mt. Shasta. Nice folks there. They are telepathic and will hear you if you say \"Hi!\"

When they spontaneously begin referring to themselves in the first person and/or when they begin asking for their own rights.

For several thousand years now, the Big Brother Nations have been watching over your lands & forests as stewards. 

We\'re not the only ones here by any stretch of the imagination. Slowly we will introduce some other co-workers.

ETOH is an acronym for ethyl alcohol. Ethyl alcohol is the type of alcohol found in all alcoholic beverages.

The severity of the weather systems will continue to increase. We suggest you take appropriate precautions. :-(

Which Star Nations here built & flew vimanas? All of them. It is the general catch all term for sky vessel.

We filter our water and oxygenate it with growing plant life. You would be surprised how effective it is

We would encourage attendance if you wish to understand your Big Brother Sasquatch Nations a little better

\"Before & after the upcoming May France cloud communication flyover.\":-)

Let us know if you have questions regarding your telepathy practice.

There will be telepathic Star Nations in your area (both beneath Shasta and in the forests above) who will be there. Say Hello! 

This shaped vessel we usually see as oceanic or aquatic nation and often research in nature.

Along with the pineal gland, training in alpha state, & holding a 7.75-8.0 Hz frequency the amygdala aid in telepathic clarity. 

Any body part you focus on for 2 minutes will result in a spontaneous increase in blood flow to that area & more oxygen. 

See the amygdala like 2 headlights on your car. Focus on turning your headlights on, then on high beam.

8) Focus for 2 full minutes on the amygdala, picturing them as highlights on a car. Think-\"turn your headlights on.\" 
https://twitter.com/OBYONETAOPY/status/723603352181977088

Watch for eyes to form in the clouds close to sunset & telepathically send up a greeting. Then wait, watch & listen.

Area 51 & other bases in the USA are just a hop from the Pacific Ocean. It is unknown exactly who is piloting this. 

If Mr. Zuckerberg would like to discuss telepathy with us, we\'d love to chat with him.

We do with our Earth a human telepaths in Albuquerque every day. 

There is a great deal of information here & the image has been renewed recently. We would expect lots of craft sightings.

The actual planetary image head of this individual is just slightly bigger than your outline--good job, Friend.

We call them sacred course corrections because so often the collective consciousness has a helping hand in this.

\"X marks the spot\" is a pretty universal phrase. Check Cygnus\'s middle, KIC 8462852, and Lyra. https://t.co/h5Gf2bZRHr

Is there a \"mega structure\" around KIC 8462852? Not one, but several networked \"outposts\" make this area a traveler\'s hub.

In all archeoplanetography images, no matter what the planet, the openings in the head are important: eyes, ears, nose, etc.

Knowledge is usually stored in the brain, and often accessed through the ear. Entrances may be found in prominent images. 

For our beginning students, If you see a Human face with an elongated skull, it is likely the People of Ea (there are many.) 

Intelligent civilizations have arisen 4 previous times here on Earth. You are the 5th.

Egyptian treasure hidden in the GrandCanyon? Archeoplanetography images indicate it was probably an Ea supply depot.

How many of the previous intelligent civilizations that arose here on Earth ended because of war? All of them. :-(

PLEASE learn from their mistakes. Do NOT use weaponry that destroys your environment. It\'s NOT worth it, ever!!

We honestly often work together with complimentary skills & abilities.Big Brothers are stewards of Earth\'s forests.

Peace and Grace be to this place.
I Declare World Peace.

This is just the beginning of a rather intense cycle. We suggest emergency kits in your vehicles and homes.

Good morning from beneath the Sandia Mtn in New Mexico. We hope you wear your day with ease, Friend.

Electronic devices, however smart they may be are often vulnerable to wrong minded external influences.

Friend, we and other Star Nations HAVE been assisting. :-) 

No one Human, no matter where you are from, can control the wrong minded. Instead, applaud the right minded--loudly!

Yes, at least three of the past civilizations made it past Earth\'s orbit to the moon and beyond.

The tipping point comes when cultures cease seeing each other as individual people but instead as an evil

Most stars are used as a fuel source at one time or another. This is not unique in that aspect.

Thank you Friend Mary. The coolest account on Twitter. That is quite a compliment. Perhaps we can go viral?

We encourage study of alternating harmonic frequencies directed at liquid mercury from quad oblique angles at 0 C.

We P\'nti were once where you are now, ready to explore our own solar system...16.5 million years ago.

Initial fear of public reaction became fear of other Earth Human groups attaining advanced technology first.

Radar & I are here to help you get to know my people, the P\'nti, just a little better prior to Official First Contact. 

If you like our tweets, please help by sharing your favorites. Thank you Friends. Wear your day with ease. :-) 

Current count at 5 AM this morning was 845 land based Star Nation folks in the 1/4 of the Earth we monitor.

This does not include the other 3/4 of the land folks, the 75% of Earth that is ocean, nor those on the moon bases.

Several advanced civilizations have come & gone over the past 66 million years. You folks (Earth Humans) are #5.

We will continue to teach and share with everyone here equally. We would like for our message to be spread. :-)

Thank you Friend Rejento. We shall make the time to understand Dr. Greer\'s message. Perhaps he has questions for us.

Keep moving forward with your understanding of telepathy. It will help you in ways you can not even imagine today.

Friend Karsh, we have been BUSY! When spring arrives, more Star Nations come to the northern hemisphere.

We suspect you will find fun & interesting results with harmonics aimed at molecules on the verge of entering their plasma state.

Harmonics directed at solid state is one thing. The subatomic is easier to influence in a fine tooth way w plasma.

We were speaking of use of harmonics as a component of an energy fuel source. Healing with harmonics is different.

This week we dealt with the Ea, 3 of the Big Brother Nations, some Zeta folks, & a couple of the other Earth-Human look-alike races

We do believe that the great Persian civilization had some help from their Star Nation neighbors in science & math.

The infinite universe gives you a chance to experience the infinite.

Understanding your physical body\'s needs, both here on Earth & for those who go exploring, is extremely important.

Meanwhile, just a little east of Albuquerque, not far from our underground complex... (we told you it was OLD.)

We can believe it. We are seeing pretty severe patterns setting up for this spring and summer. Best to be prepared.

Typically P\'nti craft are painted in a plain white shiny coating. However, some ships have BEAUTIFUL designs.

It depends on the vessel\'s size.Very large craft are manufactured in space while small ships are made on our worlds. 

A perfect introduction to microgravity research in four 60-second videos: https://t.co/88NpkckfTX

Good afternoon from our complex beneath the Sandia Mountain in Albuquerque, New Mexico. :-)

Friend, I am Commander Tlkm, but you may call me Sandia if you prefer.

I can tell you that I personally have seen Earth Humans on both Earth\'s Moon and Mars.

Most \"first world\" Earth Humans have completely ceased spending any time at night outside observing the sky. Big mistake. 

You know, we think you\'re probably right. The Milky Way isn\'t the entire universe...but it\'s a fun place to explore!

Among mammals all across the galaxy, this kind of addition of chromosomal material is very common.

Use your peripheral vision much more.! Look at your screen now and tell me 10 things in your periphery. 

Earth Humans in the last 50 years have begun to RELY on computers to remember things for them. Bad plan.

We find Earth Human children to be delightfully conscious & extremely intelligent. Go kids! You can figure this out!

yeap, the I CHING book of CHANGE says this since 2000 years b4 J CHRIST : https://t.co/y5iqtQGAfS

Absolutely you can become telepathic with birds (ask Irene Pepperberg about Alex the Grey Parrot!)

Earth Humans too often ignore or dismiss that which they catch in their periphery. They miss much!

To answer your question-peripheral vision & telepathy practice both aid in new neural pathway development.

We support understanding that there are a number of sentient, self aware, telepathic nations on Earth.

The Big Brother (Sasquatch) Nations call themselves the Beautiful People. They call Earth Humans \"hair heads.\"

Earth Humans today are the 5th intelligent civilization on this planet to advance to the level of space exploration. 

Many People of Ea have 6 fingers. Earth Humans have 5. We P\'nti from Zeta Reticuli II have 4. Others have just 3

So sorry to disappoint you but facts are facts. The first intelligent folks lived here 66.7 million years ago.

Earth Humans have not yet reached advanced civilization level 0. Feed, cloth, house & provide medicine to all 1st.

I was born on the fifth planet orbiting what you know as Zeta Reticuli II. We call it P\'ntl (say Pon-tell.)

Yes there are Earth Humans on Mars and have been for more than a decade now. The Armstrong can dimensionally jump.

P\'ntl. Our language does not normally incorporate vowels. Say \"Pon tell\" and puff your lips on the P just a bit.

There are some things we will allow released before Official First Contact but I\'m afraid that won\'t be one of them.

One need not be Earth Human to be considered intelligent and or sentient. We pay attention to your treatment of all. 

More than 95% of Earth Humans we observe almost completely lack detailed observational skills re their own world. 

Official First Contact is approaching. Are we Sirius? No, we\'re from Zeta Reticuli 2! Very pleased to meet you here.

We recommend the late night viewing. Learn your constellations while you\'re at it & how to spot visible planets.

(cigares)
Yep, these are ours. The really large cylinder craft are big enough to carry a whale pod & can easily deep submerge

Through micro analysis one would see distinct differences in chromosome 8 as compared to the average Earth Human.

If you do not know the concept of merkaba and how all energy spins, you might want to begin your education here. 

Sometimes the actions of Earth Humans simply make one shakes ones head back & forth...slowly

There is a cinnamon Big Brother Nation as well as an Ea and a Human Star Nation where red hair is prevalent

We are happy to have made friends from all over Earth via Twitter. Of course we do know you are not all bad. :-)

Yes nuclear war has purposefully been diverted at least 3 times already that I know of since I arrived in 1994.

Absolutely we have. This close to Official First Contact we\'re trying to keep you from blowing yourselves up.

Einstein was right about gravitational waves. Scientists are now trying to detect them.

Team finds rare untouched Bronze Age burial mound https://t.co/FKIsqnC5kF

-) Our Twitter account was opened 13 months ago. Our telepaths thought you might get a smile from \"Prometheus.

I and my team are P\'nti and call the 5th planet orbiting Zeta Reticuli 2 home. You may call me Sandia or Tlkm.

Mr. Rich is indeed correct. Travel outside of your solar system has already occurred. It\'s time to officially meet.

P\'nti - say Pon tee. Tlkm - say Teal come 

Which one? There was more than one crash. Yes, Roswell really happened if that is what you are inquiring about.

To our knowledge Earth is being orbited by the one moon originally designed for this planet\'s needs.

No, Earth\'s moon has several old and older (collapsed) tunnel systems as well as complexes currently occupied.

The Dimensionals are capable of a great many advanced things...thoughts & ideas becoming physical reality is one of those.

Join in the conversations on our Twitter account and ask polite questions. We will always be honest.

We P\'nti LOVE music & dance. We very much admire those with beautiful singing voices because we don\'t sing well.

There are many different intelligent peoples who come to visit Earth. We collectively call them Star Nations.

My people the P\'nti have an average life span of 405 of Earth\'s years but can live to 450 with great care.

The People of Ea have been exploring for millions of years & are on many worlds & possess many different cultures.

We find those who continue to renew their life\'s purpose, even at the advanced age of 400, choose to live longer.

Pulsars and quasars are not planets. They are rotating \"super stars\" which emit or pulse a more extreme energy.

Keep re-teaching yourself. Keep growing. Keep forming your own rightminded opinions.

I may have 239 years of experience (my birthday was last month) rather than trillions, but I do occasionally forget. 

In your Earth Human body? You might have to wait until you choose to reincarnate again.

Perhaps you meant Reptilian? Sauron & Reptilian Nations are not bad. They made sure Earth Humans survived in Asia. 

We have not been personally introduced to Ashtar and do not know all of Earth\'s visitors. We have not met.

Nope, telepathy has never paid any attention whatsoever to any speed limits (due to its dimensionality aspects.) 

We are aware & monitoring the fear levels & the Earth Human reactions telepathically right now is not fun.

Genetic modification of many things has been done for millions of years, but ramifications must be VERYcarefully.

We are observing the escalations in several locations. We do not wish this planet poisoned by nuclear war.

The planet would not be habitable by Earth Humans for more than 200 generations. 

There is no galactic cleaning service available to clean up your mess. This you must do on your own. You best hurry.

We prefer the term Star Nation or extraterrestrial instead of alien please and yes indeed we are very real.

Yes, & we also are in touch with those who are working to make a + change and encouraging them to work together.

We hope to make sure that the current Earth Humans with high technology capabilities don\'t start a nuclear war.

We hope to help prevent a global event that would make this planet uninhabitable for every living soul here. 

Meanwhile, yesterday (July 19, 2016 in the UK....this was created. We like it, we like it. :-) https://t.co/702BEktDLF

For my people, ultimate truth means that we are all part of the everlasting essence of the universe. :-) 

True statement. Big brother Sasquatch is a far better steward than Earth Humans have been over the last 200 years.

Sometimes individuals listen when you speak and other times your audience is everyone else in the collective consciousness.

Jrooti says when she looks at some of the Pleiadian folks, both their physical grace & their beautiful eyes can captivate you

No, our blood is red like yours. Genetically we are very close stellar cousins. My skin is more a creamy tan tone. 

Let\'s break this down. 1) Is time travel possible? Yes, it most certainly is possible by a very few Star Nations.

2) Are time machines small, like the size of a blender? Yes, they usually are. I have only seen on once.

3) IS CERN the site of a future catastrophic accident? NEVER open a dimensional travel portal inside the atmosphere!

4) So could this individual be telling the truth? It is not out of the realm of possibility in our understanding.

They are visible. Our smaller craft (under 40 feet) would typically be spheres, saucers, or smooth white ovals. 

This is exactly why we seek out humble (teachable) scientists like Mr. Tesla was to talk to. https://t.co/2bNlxRG8tn

Friend it is always good to hear from you. Inner Earth is an interesting topic. You have 2 major locations....

Beneath the crust is the true Inner Earth where the Dimensionals reside in a plasma like state.

Those who live in the crust layer above the Dimensionals reside in natural/drilled out tunnels, cavern spaces,

The ancient tunnel system has been only partially restored, but the last ice age forced use of it again. https

Our facility is part of that ancient underground system. We did not build it. It was here when we arrived on Earth.

Earth...please pay close attention. Your food growing land and fresh water sources are in trouble. Fix things now! 

This vessel is not one of ours. It does belong to one of the rather tall human nations that visit your system. https://t.co/ByoulaJmjn

Woohoo! Does this mean you might possibly consider opening up a dialogue with us? We\'d love to talk! :-) https://t.co/3n45Exi1Zy

This is one of the many reasons my people enjoyed sharing with Mr. Tesla. https://t.co/ocUai9wfOw 

(23/07/2016)
We will be organizing things over the next month or two & will be putting out an announcement soon regarding where & when. :-) 

The discussions are still ongoing among the 32 nations who wish to participate in Official First Contact.

Yes, the collective consciousness is everywhere. The good news is--ask them a question & they will answer, but you gotta ask. 

No, many Star Nations also have the ability to hyper focus and shut the everyday world out so they can concentrate. 

Mr. Armstrong & his brave crew were viewed my most everybody at one time or another. We took turns because of the event. :-)

P\'ntl - Say Pon TELL Let your lips puff out a bit on the P. It\'s closer if you run the p & the n together - pn.

A classic Ouijia board is not a game. It is a tool and not for children.

The local universe contains more intelligent folks than you could possibly imagine. You are just 1 of MANY!!

No, to our knowledge there is not \"war\" going on with any of the Zeta Reticuli area Nations. 

Magnetic reversals can often involve a brief but dramatic change in the integrity of the magnetosphere of a planet.

However, the premise that the collective conscious creates the universe & that makes us all one unified conscious is sound. 

1) Practice listening to the \"background thoughts\" that go on behind your task oriented foreground thinking.

2) Proactively put yourself in a more receptive alpha theta state of consciousness. You\'ll perceive more accurately.

3) Go to the EDGE of the area where Big Brother has been known to reside. Do not come with a weapon of any kind.

4) On the edge of the Big Brother area politely introduce yourself(s) & tell a little about you. Then sit & listen.

5) Your ENTIRE intent will be sensed. If you bring a recording device or camera, they will know & may not interact.

Ask permission to enter their home area. Do not be impolite. Remember, all telepathic peoples are ULTRA polite.

No one is possessing you because Earth is a protected planet & some of the Saurons & Reptilians help protect it.

Friend, let\'s be honest. Among those Star Nations who possess REAL skills in this galaxy, no one fears you.

WHICH Reptilian Star Nation? There are hundreds of thousands. You can not possibly lump them all together.

Your own DNA contains bits of MANY Star Nations, including the Reptilians originally from Earth. 

As far as fruits and vegetables are concerned, we have our own kind of grains, melons, squashes, roots, fruits, etc.

Nearly identical are coconuts & many rice varieties. Our trees & grasses are close. Our bamboo is almost identical.

Remote viewing is indeed very real. Yes, there are several facilities on the moon\'s far side.

To begin RV, first focus on light & shadow & shapes;they will be received easiest. Use a pencil & blank paper. Draw.

If you attempt to name the thing you are drawing mid-process you will lose it. Naming is left brain, RV is right.

Who needs ships with cloud camouflage capabilities! Less than 1 in 2 million Earth Humans look up or watch the sky.

Quick poll- tweet back if you spend at least 30 minutes a day looking up at the sky & clouds. Let\'s see how many do.

Spend some time outside observing your sky day/night. Sit down, relax deeply & project a telepathic \"Hello\" upwards.

We recommend 99% UV blocking really dark sunglasses. The filtration aids your eyes with more detailed observation.

Telepathy learned outside, connecting with the natural rhythms & frequencies, goes MUCH smoother, easier & deeper. 

With time & exposure to the SAME telepathic voice, you train your \"telepathic ear\" to listen for that individual.

WHEN it\'s DIVINE ANSWERS OR GUIDANCE, it\'s VERY CLEAR, no mistake of confusion possible, it comes with a sen

They will sound different, feel distinct from you, & use their own specific common word choices that are not yours.

One of the Star Nations has a saying. It translates \"all man warrior tears have been earned\" & are honored as such.

This TV series of 50 years ago truly inspired a generation of children (now adults) to reach for the stars.

The good news is there are many intelligent bipedal & human folks out there among the Nations ready to meet now.

Telepathy does not bring pain. Look to another reason for your physical pain.

Our brains have 4 lobes, not 2.The division allows us to hemi-sleep, recharging part of our brain while the other side is awake.

Potential students will be asked to fill out a questionnaire. We will be rural & outdoors. No electronics permitted.

(Ummo binary)
Nice try but unnecessary, Friend. Perhaps you are thinking of another Star Nation. No need for code & secrecy here

@ecija_manuel We we\'re briefed that this attempt might be tried, LOL.

Your words & your personalities are all intriguing to your Star Nation neighbors. hey can\'t wait to see what happens next.

MANY advanced nations in the Milky Way went thru their \"we nearly killed ourselves off\" stage, some more than once.

Merkabah energy is the energy of thought becoming creation. 

The whales on Earth sing songs that contain the oldest known continuous verbal history of your planet. https://t.co/SugQ3qnmSz

That\'s fair. Unless you are about to blow yourselves up, we pretty much allow you to make your own mistakes. :-) 

Tetrachromats are present in several Star Nations that have helped Earth Humans over the last 66 million years. 

Nnature naturally creates back up plans as well as genetic backdoors. Redundancy & variation = survivability.

Friend Mikkel, the Dimensionals DO doodle. Some artwork is meant to be temporary. Crop circles are an example.

Yes, for real.There are 7 separate Big Brother Nations currently visiting or living on Earth. All are telepathic.

Super! Dimensional beings observe Earth Humans FAR more than you know & your rightmindedness does not go unnoticed. 

There are actually quite a number of variations on the bipedal human mammalian theme in the Milky Way.

Advanced Civilization Levels (ACL) are not judged nor awarded on technological advancement.

Currently, Earth still falls under one of the protected developing world categories. 

Advanced Civilization Level 0 is reached when a world provides water, food, shelter & care for ALL its peoples. Keep going!!!

Developmental evolution spontaneous tries many variations seeking improvements, but this rise is from a mixed source.

Telepathy can come as language, imagery, feelings, auditory input, and more. All of the above are utilized.

(so why not public disclosure?)
That decision was not our choice. Ask your Earth Human leaders.

First, please understand that Reptilians Nations (millions of them) comprise a good percentage of the galaxy.

Our observations on Earth of those in power are that very few leaders here know anything of higher consciousness. 

Earth\'s moon was specifically designed and placed in orbit for your planet. Notice its perfect size and zero spin.

I agree Friend Honjaku, regular everyday Earth Humans are not given enough credit. We feel you are ready.

The concern was fear & panic & we agreed to do everything possible to not create severe upset including being seen.

No, my people are not clones. No, we\'ve been exploring this galaxy for a little over 16 million years now. :-)

No, not yet. After Official First Contact, detailed images from outside this system will be possible.

No, not all worlds have the same visitors. The aquatic nations won\'t bother with a world that has no large bodies of water. 

There are a number of tools that aid in entraining to different telepathic frequencies but after entrainment you won\'t need them. 

@ecija_manuel Everything and everyone from everywhere and every when has a consciousness. It is the soup of living energy you reside in.

We have kept track of this world religious leader and must say, we like him very much. Pope Francis walks his talk. 

Our telepaths often spot vessels peeking out of clouds too & send up telepathic message, \"Your ship is showing!\":-) 

Our telepaths know Ms. Greer & have seen her work on crop circles & orbs. This lady is spot on! We like her!

Due to an incident little more than 13,000 years ago when renegade Star Nation folks (not us) behaved badly here. 

That is an aerial species that behaves like your jellyfish do in the oceans.There are many hidey-holes on ships. 

(interference)
You have been allowed to make your own mistakes.

To be honest, some of the NASA and solar satellite monitoring feeds have caught some of them on video. 

 Yes, of course we communicate with the collective consciousness.

(no interference ?)
Oops, too late. This conversation is occurring because your genetic evolution was nurtured by Star Nations (plural.) 

We can not guarantee anything any more than a local police officer can guarantee your safety every time you go out

The economic apple cart of this planet is far from stable, however prediction of a collapse we will leave to others. 

We observe several channeled individuals, but no other live Star Nation person has introduced themselves to us yet. 

(hostiles)
First, please do not assume that all of the individuals working with Earth\'s military are doing so voluntarily

Some Star Nation individuals are still being held against their wishes.

(Allies of Humanity)
This document needs to be rewritten, but we understand your meaning and agree, Earth Humans are in a fragile place right now. 

(genetic colonialism)
There are many issues you are unaware of yet from many Star Nations in Earth\'s history. It\'s not a simple matter.

As we said, no other live & in person Star Nation person visiting Earth has come forward on Twitter to introduce themselves.

There is $ for rockets but not for clean & safe drinking water for all those in need around the Earth. 

MANY planets with interstellar commerce have groups who \"keep the peace\" among the melding of Star Nation cultures

It\'s not always about just one Star Nation on just one planet. When you have 1000+ Nations all trading at once...

We actually don\'t see it that way. When there is no unified trade system/government you have to use some kind of tool.

Friend, in the future, could you please not use the term \"aliens.\" It is considered extremely rude to Star Nations. 

Changing and evolving at too rapid a pace.

While your physical bodies do expire & break down, your nonphysical self does not cease. Instead it gets to recycle. 

All members of advanced nations occasionally make mistakes in their learning and \"walk the wrong path\" including me. 

It IS what advanced civilizations strive for, however in mixed Star Nation settings, it is far from perfected. 

They ARE intelligent & also telepathic & will sense your intent along with your emotions. They are friendly. Say Hi! 

In the highest advanced civilizations this is so. However, not all of the exploring nations are there yet. 

That makes me incredibly excited. All life is beautiful in its own unique way, from the greatest down to the single cell.

However, we must tell you that not all Dimensional Nations can be touched. Don\'t reach out unless you know for sure. 

There are times when such things drive change. When an environment is compromised, evolution CAN leapfrog forward. 

Honestly you\'ll find selfish people of all kinds everywhere you go.People are by nature imperfect works in progress. 

We recommend you seek out the research of Patty Greer. She has done excellent & accurate work on Dimensional orbs

There is a common star saying: \"It\'s ALL about the water\" meaning clean H20 is not negotiable for planetary life. 

They extract clean water from the air. See Warka Water. 

this needs to be a priority in the coming years for the entire earth if we wish to survive

A delicate balance of expanding outward chaos combined with infinite individual consciousnesses seeking connection. 

There are MILLIONS of advanced non-human nations in this galaxy. They are not separated out in any way we know of. 

Like you, our children do have \"baby teeth\" that naturally fall out as adult teeth emerge. The event is celebrated. 

All intelligent peoples will have groups who think & believe uniquely. If their actions are rightminded, they\'re ok. 

Our understanding is there is no forcing involved in reincarnation. Instead, it is a conscious choice based on learning needs. 

Friend, there are some subjects we understand are delicate matters among Earth Humans. Genetically, we are like you. 

There are SO many wonderful, amazingly diverse advanced civilizations out here ready to meet you. We can\'t wait! :-) 

When meeting a visitor to Earth for the 1st time, use good non-verbal communication. It\'s your language in common. 

The multiverse is the collective consciousness manifesting reality, creating substance (combinations) from intent. 

The Big Brother (Bigfoot) Nation visitors to Earth usually are very good at hiding their entrances in plain sight. 

Some of the cetaceans & cephalopods along with the more than half of the Big Brother Nations do NOT understand. 

Your quantum theorists are on the right track. Keep going! Consciousness very much affects reality as you know it. 

Tolerance with other nations is very important if Earth ever wants to enter the galactic community. 

To understand the very diverse peoples across the galaxy you will need to show more tolerance for others cultures. 

Good, begin at home with proactively trying to understand Earth Humans around you whose behaviors puzzle you. 

Our tunnel system was already in here & it became the center of info for visitors to Earth after the last ice age. 

Wholistic diagnosis of Earth: currently magnetic poles are acting as if a flip is sitting right on top of you. 

There are regional dialects and styles in telepathic communication. 

The manner of sending & receiving is similar among most nations. 

Niburu is considered a living vessel that travels a regular route. She is currently on her return this way. 

As far as we know there is nothing special about the souls of the many variations of Human species in this galaxy

Outside on partly cloudy nights send a \"Hello the clouds!\" telepathic greeting up. Patiently watch for blinks back. 

This is why we requested a Twitter account. It allows us to educate Earth Humans without bias toward any one group. 

Earth Humans have MANY things in common with their Star Nation cousins. Help us build bridges by sharing our joys. 

All Earth Humans have \"other\" Star Nation DNA of some kind. We P\'nti do too. We are all intergalactic crossbreeds

Within the silence of the mind there is a portal that transports you into the Universal consciousness of ALL 

As Earth Humans, you are not required to, but if you choose to, your telepathic skills will also develop. 

Do not follow the common path. Leave the path of others and create your own trail

Yes, it is. Our muscles behave as yours, contracting with sodium & potassium, relaxing with calcium & magnesium. 

(Jesus)
We understand many Earth Humans love him and his message very much. 

His personal message, \"Love one another\" I believe is at the heart of his message to Earth Humans. 

When the student is ready, the teacher appears. If the student is not ready, the teacher will leave. 

There\'s no 1 healthiest food.Chemically your body operates best with fresh local food that changes with the seasons. 

On P\'ntl we have a saying: \"Treat your people right & they will treat you right.\" Very much like \"do unto others.\" 

It\'s much more than a voice. Telepathy sends/receives emotions, images, sensations, memories, audio & intent. 

Sustainable, what a wise word. We love to hear that word coming from Earth Humans! 

You do not have to adapt or adopt anything unless you discern it is the wisest, most rightminded path for you. 

(rt) NICOLAS TESLA was in contact with ET via @SandiaWisdom 

There is another Zeta Star Nation that is quite tall (taller than a doorway in your house) with whiter skin tone. 

I have something to confess, Friends. All of us here are addicted to America\'s Got Talent. We love watching it all!

There are young & old on this planet whose singing voices could stand up to any competition in the galaxy. Amazing. 

Art, in our culture, is highly revered. We P\'nti enjoy collections of art, music, and beautiful plants. 

Yes and for Earth Humans desiring to increase the speed of their development, this is one of the best ways we know. 

To allow another to plug into you, a space must be made for that to happen. One must have some vulnerability. 

Time is not linear. All time is occurring in the now. Yes, it is possible you are remembering/seeing real things. 

(Ummo)
They are one of the Nations who come regularly to visit Earth and observe Earth Human progress

Our children are born as yours are. We have the option to have \"marriage families\" (multiple mates.) 

Soul mates translates as \"reunited\" or \"reunited in time/space/dimension\" (which is commonly known as \"the soup.\") 

Time/space/dimension =\"the soup.\" Those who choose to reincarnate together we say are \"floating in the soup again.\"

(disclosure)
Current estimation is spring/summer of 2017. A worthy location is still being discussed among the Star Nations. 

(Serpo)
We have been asked to specifically not tell you about the teams that were exchanged back & forth on this project.;-) 

T\'ni says to please tell you, \"Thank you for sending us flowers. They are pretty and made us smile.\" :-)

(serpo)
We are unfortunately currently forbidden to speak of the Star Nations who have standing agreements with Earth groups (plural.) 

(NATO slow down)
Our policy is to allow you to fall down, skin your knees, & learn from the experience without interference. 

(who asked to not tell about others Et)
My understanding is that the initial requests came within a decade after your last world war ended. 

The agreements were politely (and sometimes sternly) requested and reasonable arguments made. 

We have a sense of smell, but it is not nearly as sensitive as some of the other Star Nations. We\'re not olfactory trackers.

(DNA interference)
Yes, if you are speaking of \"unaided\" evolution, this statement would be true. Some Star Nations speed things up a bit.

If I wish to grow a P\'nti flower on Earth, might I need to help it adapt with a few key sequences from this planet? Probably. 

(Sandia laboratory)
No they are located in the Manzano Mtns south of us. They found part of the old tunnel system too & made use of it. 

Our Lady Telepath nicknamed me Sandia because she realized the location where my voice came from under the Sandia Mountain. 

And it\'s not a stupid question. MANY businesses in the Albuquerque area are named Sandia because of the mountain. 

(VRIL)
You\'ll have to ask them. This was before my arrival on Earth and not my people, the P\'nti

(Bill Meyer)
Some people who have interactions with visitors turn out better than we expected...others did not. We\'re all human.

(telepathy with pets)
When you become slightly sleepy, send a powerful thought of some kind to them (like are you hungry?) & see what happens.:-)

(DNA gardeners)
You know, all gardeners who work up a new garden plot must determine what will grow best. That means trial & error. 

When you\'ve been exploring for 16+ million years you pick up a few pointers as to what usually works & what doesn\'t. 

Telepathy isn\'t just a voice! It\'s intent, images, sounds, tastes, smells, feelings, history & interconnections

(@oyagaa_ayuyisaa Could you explain this? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST6X0Ra7zOQ)
-- was not in conversation --
PLEASE tell the Earth Humans piloting this craft never to do this inside your atmosphere or you might lose it. 

(hard to visit other planets)
Always! Each world we visit has its own properties (eccentricities & planetary quirks) that are hard on the body.

(DNA gardeners)
Because we love watching & helping beautiful things grow & observing/interacting with things we believe have great potential. 

Our understanding is when the gardening began it was a plot with potential & no gardeners. But, it had good water! 

(Amorales ?)
Perhaps it is more polite to inquire about someone directly to them and not in front of them? 

(Ummo binary code)
LOL Friend. It\'s already been tried. No need for code. You are free to speak openly.

We\'ve been making sure you do not destroy your garden. 

You also have been aided in your scientific learning and civilization growth by many worlds. 

The Star Nations around you have been trying to give you a better fighting chance at surviving your own growth. 

Your ancestors were asked and wished to be taught and aided. 

(we could success alone)
Great theory, but Star Nations have had to prevent you from blowing yourselves up more than once.

(on your planet, % of sea)
We have larger inland fresh water lakes (4.8% of our planets water is fresh) & smaller oceans (69%of the surface.)

(need help)
We are being gently honest. We understand the survivors of your last ice age appreciated all the help they could get. 

Well, you haven\'t succeeded in blowing yourself up with nuclear bombs yet either. By the way, you\'re welcome.

(astrology)
We are curious why you are so focused on the astral instead of the physical. You chose a body for a reason. 

(Fibonacci)
Yes they are. All human brains (yours & ours) are wired to find the life creation (golden) ratio pleasing. 

(we could success ourself in science)
It is not your science we are worried about but your judgement & consideration for the other 99.99% of the species on Earth. 

(preparing Official contact with so absurd infos ?)
If you do not wish to be part of the Official First Contact, that\'s okay. It\'s not required for you to attend.

(avatar ?)
No, the sketch is of my real face. No pretend \"avatar\"...just flesh & blood sketched with charcoal on paper. 

(% oceans)
Let me see if I can rephrase this better for translation. 69% (ish) of the surface of P\'ntl is salt water ocean. 

I arrived on Earth\'s moon base in 1990 for 4 years of prep and transferred to the Sandia Mountain complex in 1994.

(you are the wrong side, let them get power)
This is an Earth Human to Earth Human issue. We P\'nti did not \"let them gain more power.\" You Earth Humans did.

(interferences from long)
Are you are blaming me for eons of Star Nation difficulties from all over that neither I nor my people did? Not fair. 

We are not \"channeled.\" We are live P\'nti who use telepathy are our primary communication means. 

(Ummo binary)
LOL Friend. It\'s SOO old and we were told it would be tried. You are operating on old intel I am afraid. It\'s no longer in use.

(sea)
No, we have 3 large oceans that interconnect. We have tectonics. Our gravity is VERY close to yours. 

(Ummo binary code)
Friend, we know of the code and it\'s old usage. That intel changed on Earth a long time ago. 

In all honesty, the need for the code initially was to make Earth Humans feel safer. 

(cattle mutilation)
We are not involved with cattle mutilation Friend. We never have been. Look to others for this, not us. 

(disclosur at south)
There\'s talk of an island meeting in the Pacific to introduce the aquatics, but nothing solid yet. 

(suffering&coop with gov)
Friend, is this not an Earth Human created problem & as adults are you not expected to be able to clean up your own mess? 

If Earth Human\'s have to scapegoat Star Nations for the issues they themselves have caused, then you have a much bigger problem

(you know Ummo ?)
If they arrive on Earth & their destination is the northern or western hemisphere our facility might speak with them.

(who is in europea ?)
We are not permitted to pin point another Star Nation\'s base location. Sorry. 

If someone constantly rescues a child they never learn to grow from their hardships. It\'s hard to watch Earth Humans sometimes! 

Some folks assume we want to watch you struggle. No, we want to see you succeed, but in a more rightminded way.

Some folks assume we want to watch you struggle. No, we want to see you succeed, but in a more rightminded way.

You understand collective conscious, yes? Consider who made this and why you can only see it from orbit. Discuss. 

We have responded. It is now up to you whether to stay and learn more or go. We will not force. 

(Contact officiel public = interf√©rence)
Official First Contact = Learning that you have a great deal of galactic history to catch up on first before judging anyone.

We feel it is important for you to meet everyone and talk to them personally so you can make an informed decision. 

(portail dimensionnel film√© : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST6X0Ra7zOQ)
It is because a dimensional travel gate/doorway is being opened inside the atmosphere instead of outside of it.Dangerous! 

(no compassion)
We are attempting to treat you honorably as beings who are capable of making their own decisions.

(working with governements ?)
Our complex here beneath the Sandia does not work with nor answer to any Earth Human governments.

(we are ready for contact)
Part of the delay is not Earth Human readiness. We have 2 Star Nations who are still saying you aren\'t ready yet.

(believe in god)
Many nations recognize the Collective Consciousness as The All. Some call \"The Infinite They\" Creator or God. We do. 

16.5 million years ago when we left our solar system, we were not much higher than Earth Humans are now.

(no interference need a chart)
That\'s exactly why we requested Earth gain status as a protected planet.We wished to provide you the chance to grow.

(no one is enough representative)
When a planet like Earth does not possess one central government, who DO we speak with? Who DOES make the decisions?

(after help to survivors of ice age, they disepear)
Because we P\'nti fought to have other Star Nations allow Earth Humans the time to develop to see how they would do.

(no representative = no interference)
It might be best if you hear the entire history of Earth\'s the last 13 million years before you make hasty demands. 

(tetravalence)
Some use tetravalent logic to find a black & white answer when they really need to study the 50 shades of grey. 

(less war and poverty before to take care of nature)
Earth Humans as an entire Nation can not advance until food, clothing, shelter, water & medical needs are provided for ALL of you.

(portail dimensionnel)
No Star Nation trained pilot would ever pull a stunt like this. He would never be allowed to fly again, EVER!`

(why don\'t report the psychopathes)
That\'s your job, not ours. 

(higher dimension where flying)
Struggling with a response because you do not yet possess the language or concepts. We don\'t think higher or lower. 

(official mean with gov)
Radar says to say the English phrase is, \"Now you\'re splitting hairs.\" Official in this case only means recognized by all. 

(Ummo not on west = each have one ?)
There are several land & ocean based guidance complexes (which is officially what our facility might be termed.) 

(disclosure on Aquatics)
75% of the Star Nations who visit Earth are in your oceans. Your cetaceans are well known in the galaxy. 

The cetaceans and the cephalopods are not the only ones. You have aquatic Zeta nations in Earth\'s oceans right now.

(about Trolls)
Earth over the past 100 million years or so has hosted several trial species of humans-it may be from this.

(we are not ready but working for)
This is why we P\'nti educate not only Earth Humans, but Star Nations who don\'t know you as well. We share your tweets \"out there.\"

(don\'t treat with politians !)
We\'re telepaths, remember. Do you really think any of them can \"pull the wool over our eyes\"? ;-) 

As we stated a couple of days ago, some of the Earth Human quotes from this account have gone viral in the galaxy. You\'re popular! 

YES! This is why we requested Twitter. It was an already existing worldwide means of instant communication. 

(Archeoplanetography)
While we understand and have some of the means to create them, these were not made by us.

First, we already consider ourselves human. :-) Our people were at your stage of development 16.5 million years ago. 

So, are we \"previous humans.?\" We assume your question is where did WE come from. We came from Star Nation DNA too. 

When the Collective Consciousness presents you with the exact same information twice in short order, pay attention! 

(how many starnations)
Currently we have 32 separate nations who wish to be involved in Earth\'s Official First Contact. 

(you speak well but aware about sadness here ?)
I have personally been observing Earth Humans in detail since I arrived at the moon base in 1990. I do have a clue.

(telepathy detect lies)
No tech at all. We make sure our intent & meaning is clear. Typos however, our telepathic translator takes full responsibility for. 

Flouride and the fuction of the pineal gland do not go well together. :-( 

(after death)
There exists the physical part of you that dies & gets recycled here. The non-physical part up-cycles when ready. 

Friend Sophie, we speak about ourselves and Earth\'s Star Nation visitors. We are here to help allay fears & educate you. 

(about alien abductions)
We have asked not to discuss the details of this until Official First Contact so then you may be fully informed.

(reincarnation)
If you so choose and have learned what you set out to learn.

(what happen after death)
The crossover to a non-physical dimension happens in the blink of a micro-step. 

It\'d be nice to have more Earth Humans begin the process of learning & understanding they do not need to fear us. 

While an advanced skill, manipulating chi has been taught to Earth Humans for quite some time now. 

(about clean water)
If I could, ALL of us here at the complex (& all your Star Nation neighbors) wish for you to learn this is critical! 

(learn us)
Yes, we find that spending a generation or two studying a potential candidate worlds\' cultures helps introductions.

(official contact, absurd infos)
When you are rude to your elders, what kind of a response do you receive from them please?

As well as difficulties treating others politely and graciously.

(2 nations say we are not ready)
Both the cetaceans and the seven Big Brother Sasquatch Nations do not like the mess that\'s been made of the planet.

Not as old as I am. I turned 239 in June and was born in your year 1777. 

As time permits yes. We enjoy watching the competition of the world\'s athletes. Earth Humans can do amazing stuff! 

(absurs... => va te faire f...)
Please remember, as a telepathic people, our culture is very polite. Purposeful rudeness is not tolerated among us.

(ironis√©)
We find that humor often makes humans from just about anywhere in the galaxy think about what they\'ve heard twice.

(born in 1777)
We understand things on this continent began to change quite dramatically.

(vertues of tea)
The green has anti-inflammatory benefits. The black\'s caffeine acts as a vasoconstrictor. We think tea is worth it.

(ironis√©)
We ask for all who interact with us here to be polite if they would like to have their questions answered for free.

(besoin d\'un si√®ge d\'apoint au restaurant)
LOL, Radar just slapped his forehead. Jrooti is biting her lip and pretending to be very busy right now. ;-p 

(construire le temple de Dieu)
Oh we think you\'ll have all kinds of means of honoring the beauty that is this planet and its good peoples.

(p√©ter les plombs)
LOL, this must be a translation from other than English. Radar loves the phrase. Where is its origin please? 

(seem no intersted by jesus)
Friend our to response depends on several things. 1) Your politeness 2) Our free time 3) Our translators sleep needs. 

(greys)
Caution when meeting anyone new always is prudent. Watch their body language, eyes, & gestures to really help you understand them. 

(need to choose good words)
Yes, well spoken. Friend Dav thank you for the excellent reminder. Some times we too struggle with patience. 

Radar has been learning early aviation history here in America. He said something about \"barn storming & hay mows?\" 

(if I had z right engineers I cld probably build a flyin suit zat holds in a small rucksac,but Humans usualy laugh at my ideas)
This phrase comes from one of the worlds we help.They love to create & tinker, & say \"Never stop inventing.\"

(limits of answer)
You will find that having FUN talking with us here will teach you more science just in the aside comments than you could know.

You will find that having FUN talking with us here will teach you more science just in the aside comments than you could know.

(if we don\'t want to be polite ;) what\'s the reponse)
Silence.

Impoliteness will be met with silence. If you want to continue to get free ET intel, please respect us & each other.

LOL, some days are more of a struggle than others. My superiors told me I would need a galaxy of patience. They were right. 

(teacher)
In life, there are many roles that as we age, we find we \"grow into.\" 

(polite)
Perhaps if I explain...we can encourage science & respond to ??s when and if we see you heading in the right direction.

Conversely, we can hint if we see you heading in the wrong direction. You have to bring the matter up, we will not initiate. 

Curious minds from all over Earth are following our account & we need everyone to \"play nice\" with us & each other 

(teacher)
Please understand, as teachers, we want our students to develop new neural pathways. Our responses are designed to help that. 

(humains import√©s ?)
No, Earth Humans did slowly but steadily develop here. You may have been genetically tweaked a bit, but you originated here. 

\"If wishes were horses, beggars would ride.\" I found this quote this yesterday in my English language studies. It seems to fit. 

Your diphoton work IS important. The new particle is there, but you\'ll be a bit surprised at its properties.

You did land on the moon! We watched & cheered with the peoples of Earth! The flag is still there as far as I know. 

Please do and consider joining in the interesting chats. You will learn & grow in ways you are unaware of now. 

(Gizah)
They had extensive help. No, it was not superhuman abilities from Earth Humans. 

(diphoton)
Telepathic communication does not use special waves. Quantic intrication observed behaviors can be affected (by the skilled.) 

Strong telepathic communication creates/opens a uniquely tuned \"focus tunnel\" that crosses dimensional barriers. 

(alcohol)
Not well, lol. I can tolerate the amount of alcohol in kombucha tea, but that\'s about it. 

(diphoton)
Diphotons certainly can be a bit quirky. Radar says it would be more accurate to call their behavior \"ghosty.\" 

(diphoton using telepathy?)
We assume your ? is due to the curiously elusive, suspected possible interaction with the investigating researchers? 

Think of the researchers & the diphoton both operating within \"the soup,\" the field of the Collective Consciousness. 

(develop telepathy)
We are currently actively working with our two telepaths here to develop a telepathy course to our specifications. 

(crop circle)
To be honest, I have never been asked if I have a favorite. I hadn\'t considered it. The Dimensionals create them. 

(telepathy)
No mechanism can create the necessary telepathic connection that we are aware of. 

(galaxy leaders ?)
They do have councils of elders if you will. We have been talking...but the problems you create here are ongoing. 

(crash stestemic)
Our assessment of this planet\'s economics? Precarious! Probability? It doesn\'t look good my Friend. We are worried. 

(psychotrops)
We are aware of those used by the indigenous peoples we work with. Our brains do not like to use such things. 

(diphoton)
Ghosty...as in they seem sometimes as if under conscious control...and then sometimes not, like Earth Humans describe ghosts.

(native central america indian build pyramids with help ?)
Find copy of the Popol Vuh (Book of the Council) online in English & read of the help that came to central America. 

(war with china)
Friend Jesse, we are actively monitoring several world locations. We hope everyone keeps their fingers off certain buttons. 

(travel fast?)
For a physical human being, not that far. For Dimensionals...sure. They do it all the time. 

(dangers of AI)
We applaud Google for creating an \"ethics board\" to look at this quickly arising issue. 

(real moom)
Honest, you Earth Humans DID land on the moon. We know because WE were filmed on more than one occasion. ;-p 

(drive our primitive vehicles?)
None of us yet.Jrooti wants a hot air balloon ride.Radar drools to someday pilot a barnstorming biplane & do aerial tricks. 

No, but Radar got a chance to try an Indian motorcycle late one night in a VERY rural setting here in North America. 

(about survivalists)
They are extremely wise to have the ability to continue on without the use of electricity & keep their skill set up. 

(danger of cells phones)
Your cell phone does not terrorize you. Your emergency blanket does not either. Both stem from Star Nation tech. 

(alien tech used on earth, interference ?)
Some tech sadly came from craft of deceased crews. 

Some tech came because Star Nation individuals were held in captivity. 

You must not assume all was just \"given\" by any Star Nation. Taken perhaps. Each case must be weighed individually. 

Imagine a captive P\'nti, forced to work & to hear all those bad thoughts, trying desperately to tell \'em he\'s human. 

(space elevator)
They can give that idea up. It\'s not practical, too expensive and won\'t work efficiently anyway. 

(online telepathy course)
Sorry to tell you Friend, no. We said an online course would not work. Plans are for a really good in-person one. 

(giant manta ray)
Hop in your vehicle and keep traveling south until the front of your vehicle touches salt water. ;-) 

(money system = slave system ; like barter)
The idea of \"a good trade\" is very important.It seeks fairness to all parties in an exchange process.We like it too. 

(ww3 for official first contact)
 I reviewed plans for evacuation of Earth\'s Star Nation visitors & their families recently with my staff as a precaution. 

(com with gov?)
We have put out a polite invitation. We have yet to receive a friendly response...just hacking & surveillance. :-( 

(earth bases moon)
There are current & ancient moon bases & tech up there. Bring your lunar archeological teams, there\'s lots to find. 

(On Drudge Report their is an interesting article on Worm/blackholes being portals to other universes)
Dimensional \"portal\" creation is done, but not by this means. 

(just answered to a telepathic question)
What can we say, telepathy works. :-) 

(danger cells phones)
Don\'t stick it in your front pants pocket. It puts wireless frequencies too close to the wrong area of the body.;-p 

(com with gov)
If they wish to contact our telepaths and make an appointment to speak, any government may do so if they wish, not just the USA. 

(ww3 for official first contact)
Us too. We don\'t even want to think about it. 

(gov see your crafts?)
If there\'s a malfunction they sure can pick us up. Most of the time we remember to keep everything concealed.

(sperm count droping)
You also may wish to make sure there are no hormones in the animal products you consume. Same reason.

For some P\'nti on my world, yours is the first Earth art they have ever seen. They love to hear stories of you. :-)

(know einstein and geometry)
A flat sphere? Not even close, especially when you include the dimensional aspects. Yes, studied both of them. 

(how many worlds helped)
The total is currently unknown. Our own records from 16+ million years ago are incomplete. 

But the conservative estimates by other Star Nations say one to five worlds per year for 16+ million years. ']]; ?>
